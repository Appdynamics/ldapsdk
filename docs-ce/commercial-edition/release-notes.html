              <h2>Commercial Edition Release Notes</h2>

              <p>
                This document provides information about changes that have been made between
                releases of the Commercial Edition of the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.  This
                document reflects only changes that are specific to the Commercial Edition.  For
                changes that impact both the Standard Edition and Commercial Edition versions of
                the LDAP SDK, see the
                <a href="../release-notes.html">Standard Edition Release Notes</a>.
              </p>

              <h3>Version 3.2.1</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 3.2.0 and 3.2.1 releases of the
                Standard Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added a new version of the <tt>ldapsearch</tt> tool that provides a lot of
                  additional functionality.  It includes much better output formatting
                  (including support for alternate output formats, including JSON, CSV, and
                  tab-delimited text), support for a number of data transformations, more robust
                  connection handling, support for referrals, support for a large number of search
                  and bind controls, support for administrative sessions, support for unsolicited
                  notifications, the ability to process multiple searches with search criteria
                  provided in filter files or LDAP URL files, rate limiting, and the ability to
                  send results to a specified output file (or a separate output file per search).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a <tt>GetUserResourceLimitsResponseControl.getOtherAttribute</tt> method
                  that makes it more convenient to get an "other" attribute by name.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Implemented caching for the matching rule instance used when the
                  jsonObjectExactMatch matching rule is requested.  This matching rule only
                  exists in the Commercial Edition and needs to be loaded via reflection, but that
                  can be expensive if it's done a lot.  Caching the result means that we only need
                  to pay that cost once.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the access and error log parsing APIs to include support for the
                  triggeredByConn and triggeredByOp fields used to indicate that the message is
                  associated with a given operation.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 3.2.0</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 3.1.1 and 3.2.0 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added a version of the <tt>ldapmodify</tt> tool with support for a wide range of
                  features, including a wide range of controls, LDAP transactions and multi-update
                  operations, following referrals, bulk operation processing, rate limiting, and
                  automatically retrying operations that fail in a manner that indicates the
                  connection may no longer be usable.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>manage-account</tt> tool that can be used to perform a large
                  number of password policy state operations on a specified user entries, or on
                  sets of user entries.  This tool is completely backwards-compatible with the
                  <tt>manage-account</tt> tool formerly provided with UnboundID server products
                  (and in fact, that tool has now been replaced with the version included in the
                  LDAP SDK), but the new tool provides support for many more operations, and much
                  better support for bulk operations that target multiple users instead of just
                  one.  The LDAP SDK's support for the password policy state extended operation
                  has also been updated to make it possible to take advantage of a number of new
                  operation types.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>split-ldif</tt> tool that can be used to split a single LDIF
                  file so that entries below a given base DN are split into multiple distinct
                  sets.  This may be useful for preparing data for use with the Directory Proxy
                  Server in an entry-balancing deployment.  The data may be split according to a
                  number of types of criteria.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for a new task that can be used to trigger the rotation of one
                  or more server log files.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for "generate TOTP shared secret" and "revoke TOTP shared secret"
                  extended operations, which can be used to help automate the process of
                  configuring a user account to support two-factor authentication with the
                  UNBOUNDID-TOTP SASL mechanism.  A new <tt>generate-totp-secret</tt> command-line
                  tool is also provided, which can be used to invoke these extended operations from
                  the command line.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for the UNBOUNDID-EXTERNALLY-PROCESSED-AUTHENTICATION SASL
                  mechanism, which can be used to indicate that a user has attempted to
                  authenticate through some mechanism that is external to the Directory Server,
                  but allows the server to override a successful authentication attempt to
                  indicate a failure (e.g., if the user's account is in an unusable state, like
                  being disabled or locked, or having an expired password), or to perform any
                  appropriate state processing (e.g., to update the last login time and IP address
                  for a successful authentication, or the failure count for a failed attempt).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for parsing the new index monitor attributes used for counting
                  keys near and over the index entry limit that have been accessed while
                  processing search and update operations.  Also updated the log parsing API to
                  support parsing the corresponding elements from access log messages.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the <tt>summarize-access-log</tt> tool that could cause it to
                  take a very long time to process log messages for search operations with certain
                  types of very deeply-nested filters.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 3.1.1</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added client-side support for a new UNBOUNDID-YUBIKEY-OTP SASL mechanism that
                  can be used to perform single-factor or two-factor authentication using a
                  one-time password generated by a YubiKey device.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added client-side support for a pair of extended operations that can be used to
                  register or deregister YubiKey OTP devices for use by a specified user.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the matching entry count request control to provide support for new
                  options that allow the client to have some control over the balance between how
                  quickly the matching entry count estimate should be obtained versus how accurate
                  that estimate should be.  In particular, it is now possible for the client to
                  control the short-circuit threshold, and to indicate whether to actually
                  retrieve entry ID sets from exploded indexes in the case that the number of
                  entries in the set is already known.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 3.1.0</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 3.0.0 and 3.1.0 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added support for a new "name with entryUUID" control that can be included in an
                  add request to indicate that the resulting entry should use the server-generated
                  entryUUID as the naming attribute.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for a new get password policy state issues request control that
                  may be included in a bind request under certain circumstances to obtain
                  detailed information about notices, warnings, and errors pertaining to the
                  password policy state for the user trying to authenticate.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated support for the password policy state extended operation to provide
                  access to additional information, including the last authentication time,
                  the account activation time, and summaries of the notice, warning, and error
                  conditions for the user's password policy state.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for a new task that can be used to synchronize encryption settings
                  definitions between server instances within the same topology.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added new result codes that may be used to obtain information about the status
                  of an attempt to deliver a one-time password, a password reset token, or a
                  single-use token.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new start administrative session post-connect processor that can be used
                  to create a connection pool in which the connections are part of an
                  administrative session.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 3.0.0</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.8 and 3.0.0 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Commercial Edition of the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is now open source
                  under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 and the GNU Lesser
                  General Public License version 2.1.  The Commercial Edition source code is
                  available in the GitHub repository at
                  <a href="https://github.com/UnboundID/ldapsdk">https://github.com/UnboundID/ldapsdk</a>.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a new JSON object filter mechanism, which can be used to perform
                  advanced matching against JSON objects stored in the Directory Server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a new deliver password reset token extended operation that can
                  generate a single-use token and deliver it to a specified user through some
                  out-of-band mechanism (e.g., email, SMS, voice call, etc.).  This password reset
                  token can be provided to the password modify extended operation as an
                  alternative to the user's current password in order to allow that user to choose
                  a new password.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a new get password quality requirements extended operation that
                  can be used to retrieve information about the constraints that the server will
                  impose on user passwords.  A new set of password validation details request and
                  response controls can be used to obtain information about the result of any
                  validation performed against a password included in the associated request.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a new deliver single-use tokens extended operation that can be
                  used to generate and deliver single-use tokens for arbitrary purposes (e.g., for
                  validating a provided email address or phone number).  The new consume
                  single-use tokens extended operation can be used to consume those tokens after
                  they have been delivered.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a new get supported OTP delivery mechanisms extended operation
                  that can be used to determine which out-of-band mechanisms can be used to
                  deliver one-time passwords, password reset tokens, and other single-use tokens
                  to a specified user.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for creating and interacting with the Directory Proxy Server's
                  reload global index task.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the matching entry count control to add the ability to determine whether
                  the associated search is considered indexed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add a new get changelog batch change selection criteria that can be used to
                  target only changelog entries that match a specific notification destination.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update access log parsing support to provide the ability to get information
                  about any privileges used, or any required privileges that were missing, in the
                  course of processing an operation.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the javadoc documentation for all Commercial Edition classes to add a
                  note to help clarify that they are part of the Commercial Edition and are not
                  available in the Standard Edition of the LDAP SDK.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 2.3.8</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>UnboundIDChangelogEntry</tt> class to add support for the
                  upcoming ds-changelog-target-attribute attribute, which will indicate which
                  attributes were included in the associated change.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the access log parsing framework to add support for the usedPrivileges
                  and missingPrivileges access log elements.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a matching entry count control, which can be used to request
                  that the Directory Server or Directory Proxy Server return information about the
                  number of entries that match the search criteria rather than returning the

                  Update support for the set subtree accessibility extended request to make it
                  possible to atomically alter the accessibility of multiple subtrees in a single
                  request.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for retrieving and parsing gauge monitor entries.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the support for the processing time histogram monitor entry to make it
                  possible to retrieve information about extended operations, and to support an

                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 2.3.6</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.5 and 2.3.6 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add support for the retire password and purge password request controls.  Also
                  update the password policy state extended request to support a number of
                  operations for interacting with retired passwords, and update the access log
                  parser to support the new <tt>retiredPasswordUsed</tt> element that may appear
                  in bind response messages.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for load-balancing algorithm monitor entries.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the class-level documentation for the start interactive transaction
                  extended request to indicate that it is no longer recommended for use, and to
                  suggest alternative means of achieving atomicity and/or bulk operations.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 2.3.5</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add support for a new list configurations extended operation, which may be used
                  to request information about active, baseline, and archived configurations
                  available to the server, and a get configuration extended operation, which may
                  be used to retrieve a specific version of the configuration.  These are primarily
                  intended for use in processing performed by the new config-diff tool, but may be
                  useful in other contexts as well.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a get backup compatibility descriptor extended operation, and for
                  an identify backup compatibility problems extended operation.  These operations
                  may be used to help determine whether a backup taken from one server instance can
                  be successfully restored into another server instance.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 2.3.4</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add support for an extended operation and a SASL mechanism that can be used to
                  support multifactor authentication using a one-time password delivered to the
                  end user through some out-of-band mechanism (e.g., e-mail, SMS messages, etc.).
                  A command-line tool has also been provided that can be used to easily test the
                  ability to deliver one-time passwords to users, and the LDAP command-line tool
                  API has been updated to provide support for this new SASL mechanism.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the summarize-access-log tool to provide additional information, including
                  a breakdown of selected client connection policies and their relative
                  percentages, a breakdown of disconnect reasons and their relative percentages,
                  and information about the number and relative percentage of operations that
                  resulted in access to uncached data.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 2.3.3</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fix a problem with the CSS file used to generate javadoc documentation that could
                  cause it to appear malformed when built with Java SE 7, even though it looked
                  fine when built with Java SE 6.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 2.3.2</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add support for a new multi-update extended operation that can be used to
                  request multiple updates in a single request.  The updates may optionally be
                  processed as a single atomic unit so that any failure encountered while
                  processing any of the operations will prevent any of the changes from being
                  applied.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a new UNBOUNDID-CERTIFICATE-PLUS-PASSWORD SASL mechanism handler
                  that can be used to perform multifactor authentication using both a client
                  certificate and a password.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a new set of controls that can be used with a bind operation to
                  request information about a number of user resource limits, including the user's
                  size limit, time limit, idle time limit, lookthrough limit, group membership,
                  assigned privileges, default entry balancing authorization DN, and the name of
                  the client connection policy that would have been assigned to the user.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for extended operations that can be used to get and set information
                  about restricted subtree accessibility in the server.  This makes it possible to
                  indicate that a specified subtree should be hidden or read-only except for
                  access by a specified user.  A command-line tool has been provided that can be
                  used to get and set the accessibility of a specified subtree in the server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a control that can be used to indicate that updates for certain
                  operational attributes (e.g., last access time, last login time, last login IP
                  address, and lastmod attributes) should be suppressed for the associated
                  operation.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a set of controls that can be used in conjunction with assured
                  replication, in order to request the desired assurance level and receive
                  feedback about the level of assurance that was attained.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a control that can be used in conjunction with a delete or
                  modify DN operation to indicate that no referential integrity processing should
                  be performed for the associated operation.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add support for a task that can be used to cause the server to re-encode
                  entries within a specified branch.  This can help transition existing data to
                  use encryption, compression, uncached content, or other altered encodings
                  without the need to export data to LDIF and re-import.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add a class and command-line tool that can be used to help move a single entry
                  or a tree of entries from one server to another.  The move can be accomplished
                  using either interactive transactions or via restricted subtree accessibility.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update support for the get changelog batch extended request to make it possible
                  to indicate whether to return modifications to and/or deletes of soft-deleted
                  entries.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the <tt>MonitorManager</tt> class so that methods for retrieving monitor
                  entries now allow <tt>LDAPInterface</tt> objects as an alternative to
                  <tt>LDAPConnection</tt>.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the <tt>SASLUtils</tt> class so that if the Commercial Edition classes
                  are available, then any Commercial Edition SASL mechanisms will be supported.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update the log parsing API to add support for the new security negotiation,
                  entry rebalancing, and assured replication access log message types, and for the
                  uncachedDataAccessed element.

              <h3>Version 2.3.1</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 releases of the
                Commercial Edition:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add support for HMAC-based one-time passwords (HOTP, as described in RFC 4226)
                  and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP, as described in RFC 6238).  Also, add
                  support for a new UNBOUNDID-TOTP SASL mechanism, which can be used to perform
                  multifactor authentication (combining a TOTP code with a username and password)
                  to UnboundID Directory Server instances which support this mechanism, and a
                  validate TOTP password extended request that can be used to validate a TOTP
                  password without performing a bind on the connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add a number of changes in support for soft delete and undelete functionality
                  in the UnboundID Directory Server.  This includes a soft delete request control
                  (to request a soft delete operation) and a corresponding response control, a
                  hard delete request control (to request an entry be completely removed), an
                  undelete request control (to request that a soft-deleted entry be restored), and
                  a soft-deleted entry access request control (to request that search results
                  include soft-deleted entries).  It also includes updates to access log parsing,
                  changelog entry parsing, and monitor entry parsing to expose information about
                  soft delete and undelete processing, and a new <tt>SoftDeletedEntry</tt> object
                  that can obtain information about a soft-deleted entry stored in the server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>
