 * Server products.  In some cases, they may be based on standard controls which
 * have not yet reached a sufficient stability level to make them available for
 * general use against any kind of server, while in other cases they may be
 * defined specifically for use with the Ping Identity, UnboundID, and
 * Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory Server.

 *   supported for use in conjunction with non-UnboundID products.
